Small python scripts

The homes_SF_NY.csv is one of my favorite datasets, it was collected for A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning (http://www.r2d3.us). It is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).  We hope it helps you practice different data analysis and visualization techniques. ONE REQUEST: Please do not use this data to make any conclusions about the New York or San Francisco real estate markets. This data was collected with learning, not inference, in mind. :-)

This dataset is used in the decision tree project, in order to predict the city of the house based on its attributes.

The dependencies are on dependencies.txt
(For MAC I also needed to run ``brew install gprof2dot``)
